# Extending Atoms, Molecules, or Organisms

This section describes how a developer can extend the Theme Builder application with respect to atomic elements (i.e. atoms, molecules, or organisms).

Although it depends upon your use case, in most cases it will require modifying both:

* the user interface code in the [a11y-theme-builder repository](https://github.com/discoverfinancial/a11y-theme-builder) (see [Extending the User Interface section](#extending-the-user-interface) below), and
* the SDK code in the [a11y-theme-builder-sdk repository](https://github.com/discoverfinancial/a11y-theme-builder-sdk) (see [Extending the SDK](#extending-the-sdk)).

Generally speaking, there are two ways of extending the Theme Builder application with respect to an atomic element:
1. Adding an additional property to an existing atomic element, or
2. Adding a new atomic element.

The sections below describe how to perform these types of extensions for both the SDK and the User Interface.

## Extending the SDK

See [Extending the SDK](https://github.com/discoverfinancial/a11y-theme-builder-sdk/blob/main/DEV-GUIDE.md#extending-the-sdk).
